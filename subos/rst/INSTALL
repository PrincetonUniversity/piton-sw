This file: rst/INSTALL

To build and install the rst package, run "make install" at the
top-level directory. This will build everything, create an installable
package, and run tests.

It is a good idea to run "make clean" before "make install" when
source files have been changed.

Running "make installdbg" instead of "make install" produces debug
versions of the rst tools.

We recommend running "make" only at the top level, unless you really
know what you are doing...
