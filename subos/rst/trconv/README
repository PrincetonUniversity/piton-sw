This is the trconv distribution, a utility for printing and converting
execution traces.  Supported formats are: RST, Shade5, Shade6 (both
32- and 64-bit), and Rabin's.  It contains the sources for building
trconv.

Also included is the unaspix ditribution, which trconv uses.  By
default, typing "make" from this directory will build trconv linked
against the Spix5 library (the unaspix distribution will be built
automatically).  See the Makefile if you wish to build a version
linked against the Spix6 library.

NOTE: use /import/shade/v6/beta-2.0.0-32 for spix functions.

After compilation is complete, type "trconv -h" for help on using
trconv.

NOTE: the local rstf.h should be compared against the official copy at
      /import/archperf/include/rstf/rstf.h to ensure consistence. The
      reason we don't simply link to the official copy is to keep track
      the version of rstf.h we are using to build trconv.
