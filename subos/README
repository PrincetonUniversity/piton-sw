 Instructions for OpenSPARC T2 Version 1.0 Architecture and Performance 
                                Modeling
==============================================================================

1. Download OpenSPARCT2_Arch_1.0.tar.bz2 file to your directory.  e.g. you 
   downloaded this file to "/home/johndoe/OpenSPARCT2_SAM" directory.

2. Unzip downloaded file by using following command:

   bunzip2 OpenSPARCT2_Arch.1.0.tar.bz2

   This step will create OpenSPARCT2_Arch.1.0.tar file.

3. Extract files from tar file by using following command:

   tar xvf OpenSPARCT2_Arch.1.0.tar

4. Setup environment variables by editing OpenSPARCT2_SAM.cshrc file.

   Please set the following variables in OpenSPARCT2_SAM.cshrc file
   
   SIM_ROOT             Directory location where you Extracted 
                        the OpenSPARCT2_SAM.tar file. e.g.
                        /home/johndoe/OpenSPARCT2_SAM

   SUN_STUDIO           Directory location for Sun Studio installation
                        e.g. /usr/dist/pkgs/sunstudio_sparc/SUNWspro

5. Source the environment variable file above by using following command :

   source OpenSPARCT2_SAM.cshrc

   You may want to add the above command to your ~/.cshrc file, so that
   every time you login, it will source the above file.

6. This pacakge includes : 

   1. sam-t2 directory : SPARC Architecture Model with SPARC 
      Architecture Simulator (SAS)

      See README.sam for more details on how run SAM, build SAS etc.

   2. legion directory : Faster SPARC system simulator for Software developers

      See README.legion for more details on how setup/run Legion.

   3. README files : 
	README,		README.sam,
	README.legion,	README.hypervisor,
	README.obp

   4. S10image directory : Binary images suitable for simulation. This includes
      Binary images of Solaris 10, Open Boot PROM, Hypervisor. All these
      are used for simulations with SAM and Legion.

   5. bin directory : Set of scripts to build OBP, Legion.

   6. OpenSPARCT2_SAM.cshrc file : Setup for running SAM, Legion.

   7. License files: 
        GPLv2_License_OpenSPARCT2.txt
        THIRDPARTYLICENSEREADME.txt
        BINARY_SLA.txt
        BSD+_License.txt

   8. rst directory : RST is a trace format for SPARC 
      instruction-level traces. The rst directory contains 
      source code for trace reader and compressor/decompressor
      utility to compress/decompress the traces (rstzip).
      rst/README for details on how to compile it. 

   9. hypervisor directory : Source code for Hypervisor.

   10. obp directory : Source code for OBP.

   11. t1_fpga directory: Source code for compiling prom.bin for the
       FPGA mapped OpenSPARC T1 core. Look at README.t1_fpga for instructions
       on how to compile the code.
