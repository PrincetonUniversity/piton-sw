\ "Universal Serial Bus Specification" Revision x.y is referred to
\ as usbx.y, USBx.y, usb x.y, USB x.y in these files.
\ When a sequence such as 1.2.3.4.5 follows such a reference in these
\ files, it indicates a particular section of that specification.

\ There can be differences between what usbx.y says and what actual
\ USB devices do.  In order to accomodate actual devices, there are
\ fragments of code that do something differently from usbx.y.  When
\ this is known, such a fragment is marked in the code with phrases such
\ as "balky device", "should not have to ...", "shouldn't have to ...",
\ "may not be needed", and so on.

\ "USB Hardware & Software", by John Garney, et al, is referred to in
\ these files as "the book".  When followed by a sequence of numbers
\ such as 1.2.3.4, a particular section of this reference is indicated.
\ When followed by a phrase such as "page 23", information on page 23
\ of this book is indicated.  When followed by a phrase such as
\ "figure 8.30", figure 8.30 of this book is indicated.

\ For explanation of the USB technical terms used in these files, see
\ one of the above references.
