[ifdef] INTX-MESSAGES?

   \ Officially, this "pcie" southbridge device does not support intx.
   \ Unofficially, it seems to work for now, so the platform team has
   \ requested we turn this functionality on until the real solution 
   \ (sideband interrupts through the fpga over the ssi bus) is implemented.

   \ The pcie to pci bridge at the root of the southbridge nexus has a 
   \ zero valued, read only 'interrupt-pin' register. Because of this, 
   \ the common OBP probing code does not create an 'interrupts' property,
   \ and Solaris does not enable INTx. Therefore, we have to do it here.

   my-self my-parent to my-self		( my-self )
   4 my-l@ h# 400 invert and 4 my-l!	( my-self )
   1 encode-int " interrupts" property  ( my-self )
   to my-self				(  )

[else]

   h# 90  my-l@ 1 d# 22 << or h# 90 my-l!  \ enable sideband interrupts

   \ See ULI 1575 End Point Mode Application Note
   h# 48  my-l@ 1 d# 26 << or h# 48 my-l!  \ disable INTx virtual wire messages
