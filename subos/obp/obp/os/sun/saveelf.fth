\ This is a hack way to create a "common" symbol to cause BSS space to
\ be allocated at the end of the image.  This saves PROM space by not
\ requiring unitialized parts of the user area image to be stored in the
\ data segment.  The following line creates a very simple symbol table
\ entry with just one entry "_foo", of type "common", whose size will be
\ set later when it is determined (the size field is at offset 8).
\ The array "symbol" will later be copied into a file called "userbss.o"
\ The bytes are as follows (see /usr/include/nlist.h):
\ 0 - offset into string table for this symbol's name entry
\ 4 - symbol type (1000000 == "common")
\ 8 - symbol value (set later to the bss size)
\   (String table begins at offset c)
\ c - string table size (including padding)
\ 10 - The string "_foo", null terminated
\ 15 - padding to align to a longword boundary
