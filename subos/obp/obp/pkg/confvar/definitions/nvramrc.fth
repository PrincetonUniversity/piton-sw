\ Architecture document notes:
\ * It may not be reasonable to test the contents of nvramrc without
\ rebooting, because of temporal issues about probing (for instance,
\ the probing may have already taken place).

\ Some magic happens here..
\ The format of this option is different to the others.
\	/token		acf of normal hash storage
\	/token		acf of fallback storage
\	/w		default length = 0
\	/w		default data = 0
\
\ This format prevents using some of the other options common code
\ because the fields are in different positions. Be careful. This option
\ is also different because a set-default doesn't just free the storage
\ resource.
\ The 'old' storage will persist until garbage collection happens.
\ after that event nvrecover will do nothing.

\ Most of the time we Joe.User to know about write failures to the device
\ However, for the nvramrc it is acceptable to lose the ability to
\ nvrecover if space in the device is low, unfortunately the data->file
\ tracking is handled entirely by the hash objects and by default they
\ complain when write fail. So we have a silent flag.
