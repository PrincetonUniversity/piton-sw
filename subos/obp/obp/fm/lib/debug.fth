\ Debugger.  Thanks, Mike Perry, Henry Laxen, Mark Smeder.
\
\ The debugger lets you single step the execution of a high level
\ definition.  To invoke the debugger, type debug xxx where xxx is
\ the name of the word you wish to trace.  When xxx executes, you will
\ get a single step trace showing you the word within xxx that
\ is about to execute, and the contents of the parameter stack.
\ Debugging makes everything run slightly slower, even outside
\ the word being debugged.  see debug-off
\
\ debug name	Mark that word for debugging
\ stepping	Debug in single step mode
\ tracing	Debug in trace mode
\ debug-off	Turn off the debugger (makes the system run fast again)
\ resume	Exit from a pushed interpreter (see the f keystroke)
\
\ Keystroke commands while you're single-stepping:
\   d		go down a level
\   u		go up a level
\   c		continue; trace without single stepping
\   g		go; turn off stepping and continue execution
\   f		push a Forth interpreter;  execute "resume" to get back
\   q		abort back to the top level
