\ String-array
\ Creates an array of strings.
\ Used in the form:
\ string-array name
\   ," This is the first string in the table"
\   ," this is the second one"
\   ," and this is the third"
\ end-string-array
\
\ name is later executed as:
\
\ name ( index -- addr )
\   index is a number between 0 and one less than the number of strings in
\   the array.  addr is the address of the corresponding packed string.
\   if index is less than 0 or greater than or equal to the number of
\   strings in the array, name aborts with the message:
\        String array index out of range

\  This implementation runs fast, but at some cost in code space;
\  we reduced that cost by using w-words for the offset entries,
\  instead of cell-sized words as in the original implementation.
\  (The cost was not too bad when cell-size was /l, but with the
\   growth of cell-size to /x, it got downright wasteful!)
\
\  After the strings, a table is constructed, indexed to the strings.
\  Each entry in the table is the offset, in bytes, from the start
\  of the Parameter Field to the indexed string.
\
\  The first w-word of the PF contains the number of strings.
\
\  The second w-word of the PF contains the offset from the start
\  of the PF to the table.  The indexed string is found by indexing
\  into the table for the offset, then adding the offset to the PFA.

   swap wa+ w@ +				( string-address )

\  After the strings are all created (using  ,"  as shown above), run
\  this to construct the pointer table and fill in the number of strings.

\  It's highly unlikely -- but no longer impossible -- for a string-array 
\  to overflow the capacity of a w-word (it'd have to exceed 64K!), so we
\  really ought to check.  We'd rather not incur any cost of space in the
\  final ROM image, so we'll make the test transient.

\  Mini-forth loads this file as transient.
\  We probably should, some day, revisit the prohibition against
\  " Nested transient's" (as well as that dubious apostrophe),
\  but in the meantime, we'll do an unpretty point-solution...

transient? 0= dup if    transient   then
\  Leave copy of "not-already-transient" flag on compile-time stack
