\ Assembles the code which begins a ;code clause
\ For SPARC, the apf of the child word is left in scr
: start-;code  ( -- )  start-code  ;

\ Code for executing an object action.  Extracts the next token
\ (which is the apf of the object) from the code stream and pushes
\ it on the stack.  Then performs the action of "docolon".

\ The Forth token stream contains a pointer to the code:
\ doaction call    sp adec
: doaction  ( -- )  acf-align colon-cf  ;

\ Returns the address of the code executed by the word whose code field
\ address is acf
: >code-adr  ( acf -- code-adr )
\dtc   dup l@ 2 << l->n +    \ Converts relative call instruction to target address
\itc   token@
