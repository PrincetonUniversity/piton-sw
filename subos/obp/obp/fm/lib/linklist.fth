\ Linked list words.  Assumes a singly-linked list, where the
\ first element in each list node is the link.  Links point to links,
\ and the last link contains 0.
\
\ list:  \ name  ( -- )   Child: ( -- list )
\	Defines a named list.
\
\ listnode   ( -- offset )
\	Used like "struct" to begin the creation of a list node structure
\	The link field is automatically included in the structure.
\
\ nodetype:  \ name  ( size -- )   Child: ( -- nodetype )
\	Defines a new named node type.  Example:
\
\		listnode
\			/n field >node-data
\		nodetype: integer-node
\
\ node-length  ( nodetype -- len )
\	Returns the length of a node of the indicated type.
\
\ allocate-node  ( nodetype -- node )
\	Allocates a node of the indicated type.
\
\ more-nodes  ( #nodes nodetype -- )
\	Adds "#nodes" more nodes to the free list for the indicated node type.
\	Automatically executed by "allocate-node" if necessary.
\
\ free-node  ( node nodetype -- )
\	Returns the indicated node to the free list for the indicated node
\	type.
\
\ insert-after  ( new-node-adr prev-node-adr -- )
\	Inserts "new-node" into a linked list after "prev-node" (and before
\	the node which was the successor of "prev-node").
\
\ delete-after  ( prev-node -- deleted-node )
\	Removes the node AFTER the argument node.  The deleted node is
\	returned so its memory can be freed or whatever.
\
\ find-node  ( ??? list acf -- ??? prev-node this-node|0 )
\	Searches the linked list "list", executing the procedure "acf"
\	for each node in the list.  Returns the node for which "acf"
\	returned "true", and also the preceding node.  See the comments
\	in the code for more information.

\ find-node  traverses the list, executing "acf" between each pair of nodes.
\ When "acf" returns true, find-node returns the addresses of the pair of
\ nodes.  If the list is exhausted before "acf" returns true, the last node
\ and 0 is returned.

\ "acf" is called as:
\     ( ??? node-data-adr -- ??? flag )
\
\ ??? is whatever was on the stack underneath "list" and "acf" when "find-node"
\ was called.  It would typically be a test value used by the "acf" function.
\ "acf" is only called with valid node addresses, assuming that the list is
\ well-formed.  In other words, "acf" will not be called with either the
\ list head node or with the null node past the end of the list.

\ The data and return stack manipulations in find-node are pretty grim.
\ Reasons:
\ (a) We want the stack diagram for the action routine to be clean in order
\     to make find-node easy to use.  Thus we do not wish to expose the
\     loop information on the data stack when the action routine is called.
\ (b) The arguments to the action routine are arbitrary in number, thus
\     we cannot store loop information underneath them.
\ (c) This routine needs to be reentrant, since it is used by the alarm
\     interrupt handler.  Thus we cannot use variables.
