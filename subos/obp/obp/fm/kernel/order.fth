\ "Hidden" is a vocabulary that can be used to contain implementation words
\ that shouldn't appear in the forth dictionary.  It was popular before we
\ had the option to compile such words headerless (and also save space).
\ Headerless words made the decompiler less useful, so we added a way for
\ developers to restore headerful behavior

vocabulary hidden   hidden definitions-t

\ "Re-heads" is the vocabulary that will hold restored headers and make them
\ searchable to the decompiler.  It will be somewhat of a while before we
\ actually use it, but we need it defined now so that we can get it into the
\ search-order early on in the game.
