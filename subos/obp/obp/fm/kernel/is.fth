\ Prefix word for setting the value of variables, constants, user variables,
\ values, and deferred words.  State-smart so it is used the same way whether
[ifndef] in-dictionary-variables
\ interpreting or compiling.  You could now use IS in place of ! where speed
\ matters, because the newer faster IS is actually 20% faster than  !  (but
\ it's still not recommended practice.  Better to use VALUE.)
[else]
\ interpreting or compiling.  Don't use IS in place of ! where speed matters,
\ because IS is much slower than ! .
[then]
\
\ Examples:
\
\ 3 constant foo
\ 4 is foo
\
\ defer money
\ ' dollars is money
\ : european ['] euros is money ;

\ IS is a "generic store".
\ IS figures out where the data for a word is stored, and replaces that data.
\ The previous implementation was not particularly fast; this is much faster.

\ This is loaded before "order.fth"

\  In-dictionary variables are a leftover from the earliest FORTH
\  implementations.  They have no place in a ROMable target-system
\  and we are deprecating support for them; but Just In Case you
