\ field creates words which return their address within the structure
\ pointed-to by the contents of file

\ The file descriptor structure describes an open file.
\ There is a pool of several of these structures.  When a file is opened,
\ a structure is allocated and initialized.  While performing an io
\ operation, the user variable "file" contains a pointer to the file
\ on which the operation is being performed.
