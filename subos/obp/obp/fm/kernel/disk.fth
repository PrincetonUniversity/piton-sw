\ If the underlying operating system requires that files be accessed
\ in fixed-length records, then /fbuf must be a multiple of that length.
\ Even if the system allows arbitrary length file accesses, there is probably
\ a length that is particularly efficient, and /fbuf should be a multiple
\ of that length for best performance.  1K works well for many systems.
