\ Metacompiler forward referencing code, target-independent

only forth also meta also forth definitions

\ Symbol entries in "symbols" vocabulary:

\    The "first-occurrence" field is the head of a linked list
\ its value is a pointer to an occurrence of this word in the
\ target dictionary.  Each node in the list is one 16-bit word.
\ The last node contains 0.  If there are no occurrences, the
\ first-occurrence field contains 0.
\    The "resadd" field contains the compilation address of the
\ word, or 0 if the word hasn't been defined yet.
\    Symbols are "does>" words, but historically hadn't been.

\  It is important to keep in mind the distinction between the ACF of the
\  named word as it occurs in the  symbols  vocabulary and as it occurs
\  in the target-space.  In stack diagrams, the former will be notated
\   acf-s  and the latter, acf-t .  The notation of just-plain  acf  will
\  be used to designate an ACF in the metacompilation host, as in what
\  gets "set" in the  setaction  function.

\ The PF of words in the  symbols  vocabulary consists of four fields:
\
: >first-occurrence ( acf-s -- first-occurrence-add ) >body ;
: >resolution  ( acf-s -- resolution-add ) >first-occurrence /a-t + ;
: >action      ( acf-s -- action-add ) >resolution /token-t + ;
: >info        ( acf-s -- info-addr ) >action /token +  ;
\
\  Note:  The order of these fields is closely linked with the sequence
\  of "<something>comma" events in the definition of  $makesym

: first-occurrence@ ( acf-s -- first-occurrence )  >first-occurrence rlink-t@  ;
: first-occurrence! ( first-occurrence acf-s -- )  >first-occurrence rlink-t!  ;
: resolution@ ( acf-s -- resolution ) >resolution token-t@ ;
: resolution! ( resolution acf-s -- ) >resolution token-t! ;
: action@     ( acf-s -- acf )   >action token@  ;
: action!     ( acf acf-s -- )   >action token!  ;
: info@       ( acf-s -- info )  >info c@  ;
: info!       ( info acf-s -- )  >info c!  ;

\ Add a new occurrence of word to the linked-list of occurrences.
\ The "first-occurrence" field is the head of the list.  If the list
\ is empty, it contains 0.  If the list isn't empty, it contains the
\ non-relocated target address of the most-recent
\ occurrence of the word.  That location, in turn, points to the
\ previous occurrence.  The last one in the list contains 0.

\ hide-t temporarily prevents the most-recently-created word from being
\ found.  It is used when creating a colon definition, so that a colon
\ definition may refer to a previous word with the same name as itself,
\ without resulting in recursion.
\
\ reveal-t is the inverse of hide-t, allowing the most-recently-created
\ word to be found again.
\
\ In the normal Forth kernel, hide is implemented by unhooking the most
\ recent word from the dictionary.  That implementation doesn't work in
\ the metacompiler, because due to forward referencing, the current colon
\ definition is not necessarily the most-recently-created symbol.
\ Instead, we use a technique similar to the old FIG-Forth "smudge", where
\ the name is altered to make it unrecognizable.  "Smudge" was a toggle,
\ which suffered from the problem that sometimes "smudge" would inadvertantly
\ be executed one too many times, thus leaving the word hidden when it
\ should have been visible.  To eliminate this, we use separate words
\ hide and reveal.

\  compile,-t takes an acf-s and compiles it into

: compile,-t ( acf-s -- ) addlink  ;

\ $compile-t takes a string and compiles a reference to that word in the
\ target dictionary.  In the case of a forward reference, this may
\ involve creating an entry in the symbol vocabulary.  Even if the
\ word has already been defined, we don't emplace the compilation address
\ yet.  Instead, we just add this location to a linked list of references
\ to the word.  For what it's worth, this makes generating a
\ cross-reference list easy at the end of the metacompilation.

: $compile-t  ( adr len -- )  $findsymbol ( acf-s ) addlink  ;

\ compile-t is used inside a definition.  It takes an in-line string
\ argument and stores the string somewhere in the definition.  When the
\ definition executes, that string is $compile-t'd.  This allows
\ immediate words to compile run-time words, even if the run-time
\ word hasn't yet been defined in the target system.

\ example : foo   compile-t bar   ;
\ when foo executes, it will then search for the word bar and
\ compile a reference to it.  The STRING bar is stored within foo
