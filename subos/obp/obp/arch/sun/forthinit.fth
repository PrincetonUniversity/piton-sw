\ In:
\    up, base
\    %o0 = memory base
\    %o1 = memory size or free-memory size if %o2 is non-zero.
\    %o2 = Non-standard layout flag.
\
\    non Zero %o2 means dont compute anything just use %o0,%o1 as base,len

\ Out:
\    up, base, %o0 = rp, %o1 = sp
\
\	This routine returns initial values for up, base, sp, an rp.
\	The initialization ip is left to the caller.  Since we want
\	to provide a degree of flexibility in the assignment of
\	processor registers to the forth engine, we really should
\	be returning all those registers in out registers to allow
\	the caller to assign them to arbitrary registers.  However,
\	since this routine is dependent on the use of base and up
\	registers, and they are still assigned to global registers,
\	it's easier to leave them in place rather than copy them to
\	out registers and have the caller copy them back.  But
\	because sp and rp are %in registers and they are not visible
\	within this register window, we must return those registers
\	in %o0 and %o1.

   \  which a range of physical memory -- hard-coded to a size
   \  of 1/2 meg -- extends through the initial user segment
   \  and the initial VPT.
