\            requested minor number
\    Output: hypervisor call error status
\            supported minor number
\    - Return the larger of the requested minor numbers.
\
\    - Note about selecting the larger minor number:
\        Because guest components are decoupled, different components may 
\        want to choose different versions of the same API group. The 
\        recommendation is that guests should resolve difference as follows:
\ 
\        * If two different components request services in different API 
\          groups, they may interact freely.
\        * If two different components request services in the same API 
\          group, but with different major numbers, one of the components 
\          must be denied the service.
\        * If two different components request services in the same API 
\          group, with the same major number, but with different minor 
\          numbers, the two components should be constrained to use the 
\          larger of the requested minor numbers. This necessitates that new 
\          minor versions be backwards compatible (for example, if a component 
\          negotiates a minor number of '1', the API interfaces must still work 
\          with components that are using a minor number of '0'.
