\ Ways to enter the Forth interpreter, and their implications:
\ a) Power up - no autoboot
\	Entry mechanism: prom-cold-code, which is entered from the boot-state
\	  reset vector, distinguished this from a watchdog reset by looking
\	  at the watchdog bit in the system error register.  prom-cold-code
\	  then initializes the machine and executes the Forth startup
\	  sequence.
\	Action: perform the startup initialization sequence, then boot
\	  the operating system if autoboot is specified in the configuration.
\	  Otherwise enter the text interpreter.
\ b) Power up - abort key
\	Action: Finish initialization procedure, but enter interpreter
\	  instead of autoboot
\ c) Breakpoint (= single step)
\	Entry mechanism: the trap table entry reads the psr into %l0 and
\	  jumps to save-state .  save-state saves %l0 into the error-reset-trap
\	  field of the cpu-state save area.
\	Signature: The trap type field of the saved tbr indicates the
\	  breakpoint trap vector, the error-reset-trap field of the cpu-state save
\	  area contains a valid psr value (as opposed to -1; see the
\	  "Error reset" case), and no other special conditions are present
\	  (see "exittomon", "abortent")
\	Action: perform the action indicated by the "handle-breakpoint"
\	  routine; usually disassembles the breakpointed instruction and
\	  enters the text interpreter
\ d) Error trap (e.g. Data Access Exception)
\	Entry mechanism: the trap table entry reads the psr into %l0 and
\	  jumps to save-state .  save-state saves %l0 into the error-reset-trap
\	  field of the cpu-state save area.
\	Signature: The trap type field of the saved tbr indicates the
\	  breakpoint trap vector, the error-reset-trap field of the cpu-state save
\	  area contains a valid psr value (as opposed to -1; see the
\	  "Error reset" case), and no other special conditions are present
\	  (see "exittomon", "abortent")
\	Action: display exception name and enter text interpreter
\ e) Exittomon - Return from Unix - don't expect to re-enter
\	Entry mechanism: sun4m/machdep.c:halt() calls romp->v_exit_to_mon,
\	  which resolves to reenter.fth:reenter .  "reenter" executes the
\	  breakpoint trap instruction, which proceeds as in the "breakpoint"
\	  case.
\	Signature: This looks almost like the "Breakpoint" case, and is
\	  distinguised from that case by the fact that the saved %pc value
\	  indicates the address of the trap instruction within the "reenter"
\	  routine.
\	Action: Display "Type 'go' to resume", then enter text interpreter
\	Problem: kadb may have usurped the breakpoint trap table entry
\	Idea: Maybe instead of start_mon_clock(), stop_mon_clock(), we should
\	  provide romvecs for this, or maybe the monitor should just do it
\	  automatically whenever the interpreter is entered or one of the
\	  the monitor's I/O routines (maybe just mayget) is called. (No, just
\	  mayget() is insufficient, because we could lose characters when
\	  scrolling the screen.
\	Note: Unix displays a message through the PROM's printf routine
\	  before calling romp->v_exit_to_mon.  The message depends on
\	  the reason for the halt:
\		"Halted"	Executed from sun4m/machdep.c:boot(), from
\				reboot system call entry (in os/kern_xxx.c),
\				but only if RB_HALT flag from the user's
\				parameters to the system call is set.
\				spl6() is performed before calling halt()
\		"bootflags"	The RB_HALT flag was set when Unix parsed the
\				boot flags.  Restartable.  spl6() NOT called
\				(Is that the right thing?)
\		"system map tables too large"
\				Unix has an internal configuration problem
\		"no memory"	Unix was too big for the available phys. memory
\
\	Note: Unix starts the monitor clock before calling romp->v_exit_to_mon
\	Note: Unix does not intend to be restarted in most cases, but
\	  in the "bootflags" case above, restarting is reasonable.
\	  Halt() remembers to stop the monitor clock if exit_to_mon returns.
\
\ f) Abortent - keyboard abort from Unix (L1-A or Break)  (continuable)
\	Entry mechanism: either sundev/zs_async.c or sundev/kbd.c calls
\	  sun4m/locore.s:montrap(romp->v_abortent), which then calls that
\	  abortent routine.  Currently, the abortent romvec resolves to
\	  reenter.fth:reeenter, the same as for "Exittomon"
\	Signature: Currently, this is indistinguishable from the "Exittomon"
\	  case, unless Forth is willing to dig around in the window registers
\	  to identify the "montrap()" return address (a silly way to do it;
\	  it would be easier to provide a separate "abort-reenter" routine).
\	Action: Currently the same as for "Exittomon"
\	Suggestion: the action should be similar to "L1-A when Forth running"
\	Note: if kadb is installed (Unix saw "-d" flag), kadb is entered
\	  instead of the monitor.
\	Note: Execution of Unix is frequently resumed after this kind of abort
\	Note: Unix does NOT start the monitor clock before calling
\	  romp->v_abortent
\
\ g) Bootme - return from Unix with auto-reboot
\	Entry mechanism: sun4m/machdep.c:boot(), which is called from the
\	  reboot system call code in os/kern_xxx.c.  boot() calls
\	  romp->v_boot_me, which calls a Forth entry resolving to
\	  bootparams.fth:boot-me
\	Note: Never returns to Unix; instead reboots the system
\	Note: Monitor clock has been started at spl6() (pil 13).
\	Note: Argument is a C string which is either "", "-s", or the argument
\	  to the reboot user command
\	Note: Doesn't enter the Forth text interpreter
\
\ h) Callvec - call Unix subroutine which then returns back to Forth
\	Entry mechanism: Forth calls a subroutine whose address has been
\	  exported by Unix.  That subroutine returns, reentering the
\	  Forth word (callvec or sync) from which it was called.
\	Note: Unix doesn't do anything to restore it's state.  Maybe this is
\	  wrong.  Perhaps Unix should be in charge of setting up its own
\	  stack, context, trap table, and interrupts again?
\	Note: This is usually executed after a keyboard abort or a watchdog.
\
\ i) fwritestr - terminal emulator called from Unix
\	Entry mechanism: Unix calls either "putchar()", "mayput()", or
\	  "fwritestr()".  putchar() and mayput() are C subroutines which
\	  themselves call "fwritestr()".  fwritestr() is a C to Forth entry
\	  point, which establishes a temporary Forth environment on the
\	  C stack, then calls a Forth word.
\	Note: When executing fwritestr(), we can lose keyboard characters
\	  if Unix has disabled the Forth level 14 clock handler.  We need
\	  to make sure that Unix leaves that handler enabled during startup
\	  up until the point where Unix takes over the keyboard.
\
\ j) L1-A or break from keyboard when Forth is running
\	Entry mechanism: The level 14 clock interrupt handler checks for an
\	  abort (L1-A from the keyboard or break from a tty) and sets the
\	  "aborted?" variable if one is seen.  Just before the assembly
\	  language part of the interrupt handler returns, it checks
\	  "aborted?", and if it is set, the handler jumps to save-state
\	  instead of returning.  The CPU state at that point has been
\	  restored to the same state that existed just when the interrupt
\	  handler was entered, i.e. as if the trap had directly vectored
\	  to "save-state" instead of to the interrupt handler.  That way,
\	  the user does not see any artifacts of the interrupt handler itself.
\	Signature: The "aborted?" variable is set. Otherwise looks like a
\	  a breakpoint.
\	Action: Displays "Keyboard abort. Type 'go' to resume"
\
\ k) L1-A from keyboard with interrupts off and polling mayget()
\	Entry mechanism: an application is calling the PROM's mayget()
\	  routine in order to get a characters.  Level 14 interrupts are
\	  turned off.  The input device is the Sun keyboard.  mayget()
\	  call key_check() to poll the keyboard.  The key is determined
\	  to be the A of an L1-A sequence.  key_check() calls _enterforth
\	  == reenter , which sets the establishes Forth's trap table and
\	  executes a trap #7f instruction.
\	Signature: This looks like the "Abortent" case above.  If necessary
\	  it could be distinguished by looking on the C stack to see the
\	  interruption of the key_check routine.
\	Action: Displays "Type 'go' to resume"
\
\ l) From a watchdog reset
\	Entry mechanism: prom-cold-code, which is entered from the boot-state
\	  reset vector, destinguished this from a power-on reset by looking
\	  at the watchdog bit in the system error register.  prom-cold-code
\	  then puts a discernable value (-1) in %l0, jumps to save-state,
\	  and save-state saves %l0 in the cpu-state area.
\	Signature: the "error-reset-trap" field in the cpu-state area contains -1.
\	  Otherwise looks like a breakpoint.
\	Action: If watchdog-reboot? is set, execute the autoboot sequence,
\	  otherwise enter the text interpreter.


\ Enter the monitor with no complaints or error messages.
